					<h3>Why Web Development</h3>

					<p>
						After many years in a job where my prospects were limited I decided that it was time for a change.
						I have always had an interest in building things and seeing them develop. As luck would have it my
						brother-in-law <a href="http://anthonydillon.com/" target="_blank">Anthony Dillon</a> is a web developer, and was
						showing me some of his work, and I was hooked. So I scoured the internet for tutorials and blogs,
						and with a little help from Anthony I have built a couple of websites. Now I am looking to progress
						to the next level and find paid work for my newfound skills.

					<h3>Current Learning</h3>

					<p>
						I have been teaching myself the basics of web design and specifically
						HTML 5, CSS 3 ,javascript &amp; jQuery.
					</p>

					<p>
						I started to learn web development with HTML 5 and quickly found out that to learn HTML alone will get me
						nowhere, I had to learn CSS anlongside it. So using <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a> and <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">codeacademy</a>.
						I quickly got to grips with the fundimentals. So now I have arrived at an empase with the tutorials becoming too basic.
					</p>

					<h3>My Mission</h3>

					<p>
						My mission is ultimately to become a recognised web developer within a reputable company, that will help me progress my knowledge of the programming languages that I currently work with, and let me learn new languages.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="bottom">

					<h3>Upcoming Targets</h3>

					<p>
						I will continue to refine my knowledge of HTML and CSS but I will also embark on a journey through jQuery. I will also attempt to gain more experience by building another website for someone. Once I have a decent knowledge of jQuery I will attempt PHP.
