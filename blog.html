			<h2>A blog of my learning</h2>

			<div class="blog_post">
				<h4>7<sup>th</sup>July 2013</h4>
				<p>
					As this is my first post and I already have some knowledge of HTML and CSS my progress blog will pick up on further learning on a weekly basis with much more detail.
				</p>	
				<p>
					I have used w3schools and codeacademy to get started and then youTube tutorials. I have personally found that Jeffrey Way at <a href="#" target="_blank">Nettuts+</a> and more specificaly the <a href="https://tutsplus.com/course/30-days-to-learn-html-and-css/" target="_blank">30 days to learn HTML and CSS</a> tutorials extremely helpful with his simple examples and easy to understand explanations that make my learning both fun and informative without bombarding me with too much at one time. 
				</p>

				<h4>15<sup>th</sup>July 2013</h4>
				
				<p>
					A very busy week for me this week so I didnt get much time for learning. I did however research how to get one of those funny Icons at the top of the page (which I now know are called favicons) and used Gimp to create an icon which I have now inserted into this site. I am a bit disappointed with my lack of progress this week so I will be making up for that next week.

				<h4>22<sup>nd</sup>July 2013</h4>
				
				<p>
					This week I really got into it and decided that it was time for javascript or more specifically jQuery, so I visited my friends at <a href="https://tutsplus.com/course/30-days-to-learn-jquery/">Nettuts+</a> and found a great tutorial called <q>30 days to learn jQuery</q>. I got through it in a week but I really struggled to grasp the more complicated aspects of it and will have to review some of the videos again. once I understand these I will be moving on th the paid tutorials. Whilst watching the videos I noticed an ad for a company called <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse</a> this is also somewere I will go in the future. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I feel that I have a good enough knowledge of HTML and CSS to create websites and just need to refine my skills before moving on to more advanced techniques.
